# arki.py's development has ended
Hello there! I'm sad to say this but the development of arki.py has end and we will work on a final update to finish off some problems. Thank you to those who supported the bot along this way and arki.py will soon be replaced by a more favorable bot in which reworks a lot of the ideas the original bot had in mind. Please stay tuned for what's to come next!
